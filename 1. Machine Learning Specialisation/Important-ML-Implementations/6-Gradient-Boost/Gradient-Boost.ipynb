    "### What is Gradient Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique that combines the predictions of several base models (typically decision trees) to produce a more accurate and robust model. The \"boosting\" part refers to the way these models are built sequentially, each one trying to correct the errors of the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensemble Learning**: Combining the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance. Gradient boosting is a type of ensemble learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boosting**: A sequential technique where each new model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the error by adjusting the model parameters. In gradient boosting, gradient descent is used to minimize the loss function.\n",

    "### Steps in Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial prediction. This could be as simple as predicting the mean value of the target variable for regression problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate Residuals**: Compute the difference between the actual values and the predicted values. These differences are called residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train Weak Learner**: Train a new model (often a decision tree) on the residuals. The goal is for this new model to predict the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update Predictions**: Add the predictions from the new model to the previous predictions to get the updated predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-4 for a specified number of iterations or until the model performance stops improving.\n"
