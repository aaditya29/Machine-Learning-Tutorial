    "### What is Gradient Boosting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique that combines the predictions of several base models (typically decision trees) to produce a more accurate and robust model. The \"boosting\" part refers to the way these models are built sequentially, each one trying to correct the errors of the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensemble Learning**: Combining the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance. Gradient boosting is a type of ensemble learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boosting**: A sequential technique where each new model is trained to correct the errors made by the previous models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the error by adjusting the model parameters. In gradient boosting, gradient descent is used to minimize the loss function.\n",
