    "The Fourth Order Runge Kutta (RK4) method is a numerical technique used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It provides a powerful and accurate way to approximate the solutions of ODEs. The RK4 method is widely used due to its balance between simplicity and accuracy. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the RK4 method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Setup**:\n",
    "    - Given an initial value problem of the form:\n",
    "      $[\n",
    "      \\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y), \\quad y(t_0) = y_0\n",
    "      ]$\n",
    "    - We want to find the value of $( y )$ at $( t = t_0 + h )$, where $( h )$ is the step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute the Slopes**:\n",
    "    - Calculate four intermediate slopes (k1, k2, k3, k4) using the following formulas:\n",
    "      $[\n",
    "      k_1 = h \\cdot f(t_n, y_n)\n",
    "      ]$\n",
    "      $[\n",
    "      k_2 = h \\cdot f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, y_n + \\frac{k_1}{2}\\right)\n",
    "      ]$\n",
    "      $[\n",
    "      k_3 = h \\cdot f\\left(t_n + \\frac{h}{2}, y_n + \\frac{k_2}{2}\\right)\n",
    "      ]$\n",
    "      $[\n",
    "      k_4 = h \\cdot f(t_n + h, y_n + k_3)\n",
    "      ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update the Solution**:\n",
    "    - Combine the slopes to get the next value of $( y )$:\n",
    "      $[\n",
    "      y_{n+1} = y_n + \\frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)\n",
    "      ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Iterate**:\n",
    "    - Repeat the above steps for each time step to approximate the solution over the desired interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RK4 method uses a weighted average of slopes to estimate the next value of the solution. This approach provides a good balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, making it one of the most popular methods for solving ODEs numerically."
