# Random Forest Algorithm

1.  **Decision Trees:**

- Random Forest is based on the concept of decision trees. Decision trees are flowchart-like structures where each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a decision.

- A decision tree is built by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each step.

2. **Ensemble Learning:**

- Random Forest belongs to a class of algorithms called ensemble methods. Ensemble methods combine multiple machine learning models to create more powerful models.
- The idea is that by combining multiple models (learners), each with its strengths and weaknesses, we can create a more robust and accurate model.

3. **How Random Forest Works:**

- Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. Instead of relying on a single decision tree, it creates a "forest" of trees and makes predictions by averaging the predictions of each tree.
- The key idea behind Random Forest is to introduce randomness in the tree-building process. This is done in two main ways:
  - **Random Sampling of Data:** Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the training data (with replacement). This is called bootstrap aggregating or bagging. It helps in creating diversity among the trees.
  - **Random Subset of Features:** At each node of a decision tree, instead of considering all features to make a split, only a random subset of features is considered. This forces each tree to be different and less correlated with each other.

4.  **Training Process:**

    To train a Random Forest:

    - Randomly select samples with replacement (bootstrap samples) from the training data.
    - Randomly select a subset of features.
    - Build a decision tree using the selected samples and features. Repeat this process to grow multiple trees.
    - For prediction, aggregate the predictions of all trees (e.g., for classification, use majority voting; for regression, use averaging).
