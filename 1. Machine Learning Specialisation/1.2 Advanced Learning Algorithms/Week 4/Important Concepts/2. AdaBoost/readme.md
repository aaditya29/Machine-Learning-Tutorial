# AdaBoost Method

Adaboost (Adaptive Boosting) is a popular ensemble learning algorithm used for classification problems. It combines the predictions of several weak classifiers (learners that perform slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong classifier. The key idea behind Adaboost is to iteratively train these weak classifiers while giving more weight to previously misclassified samples, thereby focusing subsequent learners on the hard-to-classify examples.
