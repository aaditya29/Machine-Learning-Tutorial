### Decision Trees Learning

A decision tree is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It models decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure. The learning process involves constructing a decision tree from a given dataset, where the tree is built recursively by splitting the data into subsets based on the values of different attributes.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the learning process:
