# Important Notes Week 1

## Neural Network Intuition

**Biological Neurons: The Blueprint**

- **Dendrites:** Imagine these as the input branches of a neuron. They receive signals from other neurons.
- **Soma (Cell Body):** This is the core of the neuron. It processes the incoming signals it receives.
- **Axon:** Think of this as the output line. If a neuron gets sufficiently excited by the input signals, the axon transmits its own electrical impulse.
- **Synapses:** These are the junctions where neurons connect. Signals are transmitted across the synapse using chemicals called neurotransmitters.

**Artificial Neural Networks: The Mathematical Model**

Inspired by the structure of the brain, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of these key elements:

- **Inputs:** These represent the data that enters the network (like pixels in an image).
- **Neurons (Nodes):** These are the processing units. They take inputs, multiply them by weights (which simulate the strength of a connection, similar to synapses), and apply an activation function to determine the neuron's output.
- **Outputs:** These are the final results produced by the network (e.g., the classification of an image).
- **Layers:** ANNs are often organized into layers. Information flows from input, through potentially many "hidden" layers, finally reaching the output layer.
