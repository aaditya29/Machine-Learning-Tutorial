## Neural Network Intuition

**Biological Neurons: The Blueprint**

- **Dendrites:** Imagine these as the input branches of a neuron. They receive signals from other neurons.
- **Soma (Cell Body):** This is the core of the neuron. It processes the incoming signals it receives.
- **Axon:** Think of this as the output line. If a neuron gets sufficiently excited by the input signals, the axon transmits its own electrical impulse.
- **Synapses:** These are the junctions where neurons connect. Signals are transmitted across the synapse using chemicals called neurotransmitters.
