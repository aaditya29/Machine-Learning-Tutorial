# Important Notes Week 1

## Supervised VS. Unsupervised Machine Learning

#### 1. What is Machine Learning?<br>

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to enable computers to learn and improve their performance over time. It allows computers to make predictions, classify information, cluster data, and more, by finding relationships and patterns in data.<br>

#### 2. Supervised Learning:

Imagine you're teaching a computer to recognize different types of fruits. You gather a bunch of examples where each fruit is labeled (like apples, oranges, and bananas).

- **Data Collection**: You show the computer pictures of apples, oranges, and bananas. Each picture comes with a label, telling the computer what fruit it is.
- **Training**: The computer learns by looking at these pictures and labels. It figures out patterns and features that distinguish apples from oranges and bananas.
- **Testing**: Once the computer thinks it has learned enough, you give it new pictures of fruits it has never seen. You check how well it can correctly identify these fruits based on what it learned during training.
- **Feedback and Improvement**: If it makes mistakes, you correct it, and it learns from those mistakes. You repeat this process until the computer gets really good at recognizing different fruits.
- **Prediction**: Now, when you show it a new picture of a fruit, it should be able to tell you whether it's an apple, orange, or banana based on what it learned.

So, in a nutshell, supervised learning is like teaching a computer to make predictions or identify things by showing it examples and providing feedback until it gets really good at it. It's a bit like how we learn by being shown examples and receiving feedback on what's right or wrong.

#### 3. Unsupervised Learning:

Imagine you have a bunch of different fruits, but this time, you don't have labels telling you what each fruit is. You just have a mix of apples, oranges, and bananas.

- **Sorting without Labels**: Unsupervised learning is like trying to sort these fruits into groups without any hints or labels. You don't know which ones are apples, oranges, or bananas initially.

- **Finding Patterns on Its Own**: The computer starts looking at the fruits and tries to find patterns or similarities. It might notice that some fruits are round, some are elongated, and others have different colors.

- **Grouping Similar Things Together**: Based on these patterns, the computer groups similar-looking fruits together. It doesn't know their names, but it sees that certain fruits share common characteristics.

- **Clustering**: This process is called clustering. The computer is essentially saying, "These fruits look alike, so they must belong to the same group." It forms clusters without being told what each cluster represents.

- **Discovering Structure**: After forming these groups, you might notice that within each group, the fruits have something in common. Maybe one cluster has mostly red fruits, another has mostly yellow fruits, and so on.

In a nutshell, unsupervised learning is like letting the computer explore and find its own patterns in data without being told what to look for. It's great for discovering hidden structures or relationships in information, even when you don't have predefined categories.
