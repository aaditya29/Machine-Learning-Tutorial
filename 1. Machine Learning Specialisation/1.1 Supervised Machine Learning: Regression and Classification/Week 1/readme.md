## Supervised VS. Unsupervised Machine Learning

#### 1. What is Machine Learning?<br>

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to enable computers to learn and improve their performance over time. It allows computers to make predictions, classify information, cluster data, and more, by finding relationships and patterns in data.<br>

#### 2. Supervised Learning:

Imagine you're teaching a computer to recognize different types of fruits. You gather a bunch of examples where each fruit is labeled (like apples, oranges, and bananas).

- **Data Collection**: You show the computer pictures of apples, oranges, and bananas. Each picture comes with a label, telling the computer what fruit it is.
- **Training**: The computer learns by looking at these pictures and labels. It figures out patterns and features that distinguish apples from oranges and bananas.
- **Testing**: Once the computer thinks it has learned enough, you give it new pictures of fruits it has never seen. You check how well it can correctly identify these fruits based on what it learned during training.
- **Feedback and Improvement**: If it makes mistakes, you correct it, and it learns from those mistakes. You repeat this process until the computer gets really good at recognizing different fruits.
- **Prediction**: Now, when you show it a new picture of a fruit, it should be able to tell you whether it's an apple, orange, or banana based on what it learned.

So, in a nutshell, supervised learning is like teaching a computer to make predictions or identify things by showing it examples and providing feedback until it gets really good at it. It's a bit like how we learn by being shown examples and receiving feedback on what's right or wrong.
